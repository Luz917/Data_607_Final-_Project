1,Social Media and Adolescents’ and Young Adults’ Mental Health | National Center for Health Research,"
		Elina Mir and Caroline Novas, National Center for Health Research
Most young adults use social media, and experts are asking if this use can harm mental health. Here’s what you need to know.
The most popular social media platforms are Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. According to the Pew Research Center, 78% of 18-24-year-olds use Snapchat, while 71% use Instagram, and 68% use Facebook. In addition, 94% of 18-24 years olds use YouTube and 45% use Twitter.1
What do social media outlets allow? How are social media platforms used?
Snapchat allows users to share photos and “stories” with their friends that disappear after 24 hours. These “stories” allow users to share their experiences with all followers through videos or photos. Instagram lets users share their life through photos or videos with a wider audience and are not temporary like Snapchat. Many people use this platform for blogging, posting videos from vacations as well as daily life, and sharing their interests in art, cooking, and other activities. Facebook lets users to share photos, videos, and articles; share information about their lives; chat with friends; and more. YouTube allows users to share original videos, such as music, cooking, make-up tutorials, and vlogs. Twitter allows users to share their thoughts and personal updates in 280 characters or less. All of these outlets are also popular sources for news as well as celebrity gossip.
The Benefits
Social media benefits adolescents by enabling them to enhance their communication skills and social connections. Social media sites and apps allow adolescents to make new friends, exchange ideas and pictures, develop new interests and experiment with new forms of self-expression. When youth use them, they can learn basic social and technical skills that are important for functioning in day-to-day society. Most adolescents use social media to build on social communication and friendships taking place at school or during sports and other activities and extend it to the online world. They are not necessarily meeting new people so much as enriching their currently existing friendships. Because of this, barring teens from social media use could potentially deprive them of valuable learning experiences and limits their social lives.
Is social media tied to mental health?
Social media has become immensely popular, and in recent years mental disorders among young adults has become more common. That doesn’t mean they are related, but the numbers are staggering and deserve attention. In 2016, an estimated of 44.7 million adults aged 18 or older in the US had a mental illness. Young adults aged 18-25 had the highest prevalence of any mental illness at 22.1% compared to adults aged 26-49 at 21.1% and aged 50 and older at 14.5%.2
“Facebook depression” is a concern resulting from children’s use of social media. A report by the American Academy of Pediatrics defines Facebook depression as “depression that develops when teens and preteens spend time on social media sites and then begin to exhibit classic symptoms of depression due to the intensity of the online world.”3 The factors that may contribute to depression are the various measures of popularity that Facebook creates. In particular, Facebook can make kids feel inadequate due to the “in-your-face” friend tallies, status updates, and pictures of others having a good time. For well-adjusted kids, however, social media can have the opposite effect, boosting their already positive feelings about themselves.3
Why is this? As it turns out, well-adjusted children tend to put their best foot forward, broadcasting only their best attributes and qualities online. They choose what to reveal about themselves and filter or minimize negative characteristics. They are able, in other words, to promote a somewhat deceptively positive sense of self. In response, their friends’ feedback, comments, and posts tend to be overwhelmingly positive, creating a positive feedback loop. For less well-adjusted children, constantly reading about the seeming success of their Facebook “friends” can make them feel worse than in real life where, at least, their peers visibly fail from time to time. The positive spin that popular kids put on Facebook ends up widening the disconnect between how less well-adjusted or unpopular kids view others and how they view themselves. However, it is unknown whether Facebook Depression is a distinct phenomenon or an extension of depression adolescents feel in other circumstances. The American Psychiatric Association does not list Facebook Depression (or Internet addiction) in its diagnostic manual.
According to the Pew Research Center, by 2015, 73% of teens had smartphones. One psychology professor at San Diego State University discovered that teens who spend 5 or more hours a day online were 71% more likely to have at least one risk factor for suicide compared to teens who spent only 1 hour a day online. This risk increases with only two or more hours spent online.4 Again, this doesn’t prove that spending time online causes suicide, but the link between time spent online and other factors linked to suicide is important to study.
The number of social media platforms used and how often they are used is related to youth mental health. A recent study found that the more social media platforms an adolescent uses, the more likely they are to have symptoms of depression and anxiety, regardless of overall time spent on social media.5
Another study looked at social media use and social isolation among U.S. young adults. The study used a nationally representative sample of 1,787 19-32-year-olds. It assessed participants’ usage of 11 social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat, and Reddit. The study found that those who visited any platforms at least 58 times per week were three times more likely to feel socially isolated compared to those who used social media fewer than 9 times per week.6 The researchers concluded that young adults saw themselves as being socially isolated from their peers whether or not it was actually true. Just because they believe that they lack friends doesn’t mean that they do.  In addition to feelings of social isolation and depression, social media has also been found to be associated with self-image. A study found that greater Instagram use was associated with greater self-objection and concern about body image.7
Should Parents Be Worried?
It is obvious that not all social media sites are healthy environments for adolescents. Bullying, cliques, and sexual experimentation are just as prevalent online as offline. Because children are not good at self-regulation and are susceptible to peer pressure, social media sites can be dangerous places to “hang out.” The minimum age to access social media sites is 13 because the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act prohibits websites from collecting information on children younger than 13 without parental permission. However, age is based on self-report, so children younger than 13 can simply lie about their age and open accounts.3
Most parents do not fully comprehend social networking sites. And, with many parents’ busy schedules, this leaves many kids unsupervised in the online world, which can lead to problems. Parental supervision is as valuable online as it is offline in instilling values and safeguards.
Parents should check in regularly with their children to ensure that their online behavior is appropriate. Although it is tempting to accomplish this through frequent monitoring, this can result in distrust between parent and child. Parents should talk about appropriate media use early and build a relationship of trust surrounding social media. This way, when there is a problem your teen will be more likely to talk to you.

What Should You Do?
If you think you or your child might be using social media too much or that social media may be affecting your mental health or the health of someone you know, consider these tips:
Turn off your notifications for at least a few hours each day (which you can gradually increase); put your phone in “Airplane” mode or “Do Not Disturb”.
Delete apps that contribute to unhealthy body image or other feelings of inadequacy. Add apps that help you feel better about yourself or inspire you to engage in healthy behaviors. Meditation apps can be a better use of your time, for example: Calm, Insight Timer, and Headspace. Here is an article with more app suggestions. Use apps that block certain other apps and tell you about your usage. This will help to increase your awareness of how much you are engaging with social media and help you focus on other activities.
Use an alarm clock instead of relying on your phone as an alarm to prevent you from using your phone the minute you wake up.
Take a day off from social media to focus on other things. Sunday is a good suggestion since it is a day when you probably aren’t in school or at work.
Consider putting your phone in grayscale. This makes your phone less enticing to look at. With the colorful apps and notifications changed to gray, they may be easier to ignore.
Set boundaries or only certain times when you can check your notifications.
Start a habit of placing your phone near the door when you come home — doing it with a friend, partner, or family member can help you stay motivated and accountable! Make a plan with a group of friends to spend more time hanging out in person and less time interacting via social media.
If you are a parent wanting to learn more about how to limit your child or teenager’s social media use, check out these additional tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Looking to the Future
Consider how you would ideally like to spend your time. Ask yourself: How much time do I want to spend using social media? How can I connect with people I care about in other ways, such as talking on the phone or meeting in person?
Learn to balance your social media use and incorporate some of these tips into your life. Of course, if you are suffering from depression or anxiety seek treatment.

2,The Negative Effects of Social Media for Teens - SmartSocial,"1,312shares Print This Page510 Facebook408 Email To A Friend188 Twitter104 Gmail102
The next generation will enter adulthood wired by life online. There are plenty of debates about the effects of social media on tweens and teens. While scientists work to figure out exactly what all of today’s technology is doing to our bodies and brains, the Smart Social team believes social media has turned into an unhealthy obsession for society. We want to help parents and educators understand how big the online addiction problem is, so we can all work together to help kids around the world stay safe and healthy from the negative effects of social media.

The negative effects of social media



RSPH and the Young Health Movement (YHM) published a report examining the positive and negative effects of social media on young people’s health, including a list of social media platforms according to their impact on young people’s mental health.



Study reveals that social media leads to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, poor body image, and loneliness







“Too few of us are paying attention to how our teenagers’ use of technology—much more intense and intimate than a 3-year-old playing with dad’s iPhone—is affecting them. In fact, experts worry that the social media and text messages that have become so integral to teenage life are promoting anxiety and lowering self-esteem.”

Current research suggests that the negative effects of social media feel bigger than the positive effects







“Read enough of the current research and you’ll find that the negatives tend to feel bigger than the positives. While teens can use social media to connect and create friendships with others, they also confront cyberbullying, trolls, toxic comparisons, sleep deprivation, and less frequent face-to-face interactions, to name a few.



Too much time spent scrolling through social media can result in symptoms of anxiety and/or depression.”

Our founder, Josh Ochs believes there are FOUR Cs to social media



The good parts of social media are:



Connecting – when we use social media for connecting, we are growing our network of real people and helping to be more social. We are using social media as a tool to be more interactive with people



Communication – When we communicate (by direct messaging or emailing people) to invite them to events or ask them questions, we are interacting in a positive way and using our devices with a purpose.



The BAD parts of social media are:



Comparing – When we compare ourselves to others (the way they look, where they go on vacation or who they are dating) we are comparing ourselves to them. This causes anxiety and depression.



Consuming – When we have a spare moment in line at the bank, or we are bored in the passenger seat in the car, we might open our phone to check our instagram feed. This is us filling the spaces by consuming other people’s social media with the endless feed on Instagram/Snap/Facebook, etc. Consumption robs us of great ideas, interactions and makes us less focused.



Negative effects of social media



Anxiety & depression:Research suggests that young people who spend more than 2 hours per day on social media are more likely to report poor mental health, including psychological distress (symptoms of anxiety and depression).



Sleep:Numerous studies have shown that increased social media use has a significant association with poor sleep quality in young people. Using phones, laptops, and tablets at night before bed is also linked with poor quality sleep.



Body image:Body image is an issue for many young people, both male and female. Studies have shown that when women in their teens and early twenties view Facebook for only a short period of time, body image concerns are higher compared to non-users.



Cyberbullying:Bullying during childhood is a major risk factor for a number of issues including mental health, education and social relationships, with long-lasting effects often carried right through to adulthood.



Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):FOMO has been robustly linked to higher levels of social media engagement, meaning that the more an individual uses social media, the more likely they are to experience FOMO.



Positive effects of social media



Access to expert health info:Social networking offers young people who may be suffering from mental health issues an opportunity to read, watch or listen to, and understand, the health experiences of others – relating them back to their own reality.



Emotional support:Conversations on social media can emerge and provide young people with essential interaction to overcome difficult health issues, particularly when they may not have access to that support face-to-face.



Community building:The community building aspect of social media is also distinctly positive for many young people. By joining ‘groups’ or ‘pages’ young people can surround themselves with like-minded people and share their thoughts or concerns.



Self-expression:Self-expression and self-identity are important aspects of development throughout the teen years. Social media can act as an effective platform for positive self-expression, letting teens put forward their best self.



Building upon relationships:There is evidence to suggest that strong adolescent friendships can be enhanced by social media interaction, allowing young people to create stronger bonds with people they already know.



Teen social media statistics



91% of 16-24 year olds use the internet for social networkingSocial media use is linked with increased rates of anxiety, depression and poor sleepSocial media has been described as more addictive than cigarettes and alcoholThe negative effects of social media in the news:



“Social media addiction is a mental health problem… Excessive usage [is] linked to relationship problems, worse academic achievement and less participation in offline communities.” –BBC



“The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying.” –Forbes



“Survey results found that Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram all led to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, poor body image and loneliness.” –Child Mind Institute



“Too much passive use of social media – just browsing posts – can be unhealthy and has been linked to feelings of envy, inadequacy and less satisfaction with life. Studies have even suggested that it can lead to ADHD symptoms, depression, anxiety and sleep deprivation. ” –UNICEF



What age should a student be on social media?



Ages 0-13 – PrivateAge 12 – Have a family discussion regarding what your student’s online brand should look likeAge 13 – Social media signed contractAge 13-15 – Build a personal portfolio and start putting positive volunteer photos online. Then get on Instagram as an extension of the personal brandAge 14-15 – Publish the portfolio as a website so it improves your student’s Google resultsAge 17 – Colleges should be able to find a positive online footprint for your studentWhen should I give my kids a cell phone?



Our suggestions:



Ages 0-10 – No phoneAges 10-13 – Flip phone (SMS/text, phone calls)Age 13 – Cell phone safety contractAge 14 – Smartphone (without social media apps installed)Age 15 – Smartphone (with social media apps installed)What can parents do to keep their children safe from the negative effects of social media?



Start a dialog about social media with your kids at a young age and talk regularlyEnsure your children are equipped with the relevant skills to be able to navigate social mediaLead by example and model positive behaviors for your childTeach students that social media can and should be utilized as a tool for goodEnsure your children are equipped with the relevant skills to be able to navigate social mediaConsider joining Parent University to get videos you can watch WITH your children. These videos will start a healthy dialog that will keep them safe and smart onlineRemind students that they can always come to you or a trusted adult if they ever need helpWait until your child has shown that they can handle the responsibility of using social media before letting them set up their first profileWhen you’re ready for your child to be online, read our Parent App Guide page to learn how teens can use social media safelyConclusion



Society’s obsession with social media isn’t going away any time soon. It’s the job of parents and educators to teach kids about these negative effects before they become addicted. If you need help talking with your kids about the dangers of social media and how they can use it in a positive way, we have some talking points for you here.

                    Article BodyPediatricians are adding another topic to their list of 
questions for   visits with school-aged and adolescent patients: Are you
 on Facebook?  Recognizing the increasing importance of all   types of 
media in their young patients’ lives, pediatricians often hear from   
parents who are concerned about their children’s engagement with social 
  media.






























To help   address 
the many effects—both positive and negative—that social media use has on
 youth and families, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued
 a   new clinical report, “The Impact of Social Media Use on Children, Adolescents   and Families” in the April issue of Pediatrics
 (published online March 28).   The report offers background on the 
latest research in this area, and   recommendations on how 
pediatricians, parents and youth can successfully   navigate this new 
mode of communication. 






























“For some   teens 
and tweens, social media is the primary way they interact socially, 
rather   than at the mall or a friend’s house,” said Gwenn O’Keeffe, MD,
 FAAP, co-author   of the clinical report. “A large part of this 
generation’s social and emotional   development is occurring while on 
the Internet and on cell phones. Parents need   to understand these 
technologies so they can relate to their children’s online   world – and
 comfortably parent in that   world.” See Dr. O'Keefe discussing social media at the following links:

According   to a 
Common Sense Media poll from August 2009, 22 percent of teenagers log on
 to   their favorite social media site more than 10 times a day, and 
more than half of   adolescents log on to a social media site more than 
once a day. Seventy-five   percent of teens now own cell phones, and 25 
percent use them for social media,   54 percent for texting, and 24 
percent for instant messaging. 






























The new AAP   
guidelines include recommendations for pediatricians to help families 
navigate   the social media landscape,   including:






























Advise   
parents to talk to children and adolescents about their online use and 
the   specific issues that today’s online kids face, such as 
cyberbullying, sexting,   and difficulty managing their   time. 
  


Advise   
parents to work on their own “participation gap” in their homes by 
becoming   better educated about the many technologies their children 
are   using. 
  


Discuss   with families the need for a family online-use   plan, with an emphasis on citizenship and healthy behavior.     
  
  


Discuss   
with parents the importance of supervising online activities via active 
  participation and communication, not just via monitoring   software.





























The AAP   report 
outlines the positive effects of social media. Engagement in social 
media   and online communities can enhance communication, facilitate 
social interaction   and help develop technical skills. They can help 
tweens and teens discover   opportunities to engage in the community by 
volunteering, and can help youth   shape their sense of identity. These 
tools also can be useful adjuncts to—and in   some cases are 
replacing—traditional learning methods in the   classroom.






























But because   
tweens and teens have a limited capacity for self-regulation and are 
susceptible   to peer pressure, they are at some risk as they engage in 
and experiment with   social media, according to the report. They can 
find themselves on sites and in   situations that are not 
age-appropriate, and research suggests that the content   of some social
 media sites can influence youth to engage in risky behaviors. In   
addition, social media provides venues for cyberbullying and sexting, 
among   other dangers. Youth who are more at-risk offline tend to also 
be more at-risk   online.






























“Some young   
people find the lure of social media difficult to resist, which can 
interfere   with homework, sleep and physical activity,” Dr. O’Keeffe 
said. “Parents need to   understand how their child is using social 
media so that they can set   appropriate limits.” 






























Parents   also 
should educate their children about the ways social media sites can 
capture   personal information about users, Dr. O’Keeffe said. Young 
people can harm their   reputations and safety by posting personal and 
inappropriate information. And   information about sites they visit may 
be captured and used to target them with   advertising. 






























The report   includes a link to parenting tips, “Talking to Kids and Teens About Social Media   and Sexting”.
